I am an engineer with degrees from Europe, Asia, and the US. I am passionate about leveraging the latest technologies to build reliable and scalable systems.

I was in the founding team of Campuswire, a company that recently [raised $29 Million ](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2023-05-01/education-startup-campus-edu-opens-enrollment-with-29-million-in-funding) in funding from investors such as **Discord** founder Jason Citron and
**OpenAI** founder Sam Altman.

In 2018 I moved to Turbonomic, a company specializing in leveraging AI to optimize resources in hybrid and multicloud environments. There, I quickly became the tech lead of the platform team and moved to IBM through [Turbonomic's acquisition](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-06-17-IBM-Closes-Acquisition-of-Turbonomic-to-Deliver-Comprehensive-AIOps-Capabilities-for-Hybrid-Cloud) and worked in the **IBM Cloud and Cognitive Software Deparment**.

I'm currently a Founding Engineer at a stealth mode startup that is building a product that lies at the intersection of the financial world and music.
