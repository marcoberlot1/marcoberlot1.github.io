I am an engineer with degrees from Europe, Asia, and the US, and have been a part of the founding teams of several startups.

My technical expertise lies in cloud computing and distributed systems, and I am passionate about leveraging the latest technologies to build reliable and scalable systems. I'm also interested in connecting tech principles to human systems like markets, education & government.
